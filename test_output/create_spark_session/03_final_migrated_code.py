```python
def create_spark_session(app_name: str = "DataProcessingApp") -> Session:
    """Create and configure Snowpark session for data processing workloads.
    
    This function initializes a Snowpark Session which provides optimizations
    at the platform level. Snowflake handles query optimization automatically
    through its query optimizer, eliminating the need for manual configuration
    of execution strategies.
    
    Args:
        app_name (str, optional): Name of the application for identification purposes.
            Defaults to "DataProcessingApp".
    
    Returns:
        Session: Configured Snowpark session instance. Snowflake manages
            query optimization automatically without requiring manual AQE configuration.
    
    Note:
        Snowflake provides automatic query optimization at the platform level,
        so explicit adaptive query execution configuration is not needed.

    # TODO: [MANUAL MIGRATION REQUIRED] - Snowpark sessions are typically created
    # using connection parameters or existing connection. This function needs
    # connection configuration to establish session with Snowflake.
    # Example approach:
    # session = Session.builder.configs(connection_parameters).create()
    
    # Snowflake handles query optimization automatically through its query optimizer
    # No equivalent configuration needed for adaptive query execution features
    # as these are managed transparently by the Snowflake platform
    
    # TODO: [MANUAL MIGRATION REQUIRED] - Return appropriate session instance
    # return session
